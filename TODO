LSP:Goto next reference 

Have the hover menu print the man page for the function if available

Have a way to show type definitions in a hover menu instead of having to jump
or atleast have the option between the two

Add a way to choose to get your lsp information in a hover window, a popup
window, in a split or jumping to the requested information

null-ls

omnifunc
appearance of hover menu
appearance of completion menu

Creating custom snippets and getting snippet keybindings working

Add a menu for selecting your executable file and args
Have the menu have memory form the previous run
Have the menu also find executable files for you to choose from
the menu could also provide an option to build maybe

make lsp responses that appear on the same line just take you to that line
instead of showing you a quickfix menu with two options that bring to the same
line - its annoying


Look into nvim-libmodal
    - See if you could have a debug mode so that you don't need to prefix
      gdb-like keybindings with leader
    - Diagnostic mode? idk maybe
    - i bet there are a bunch of ways to use this

    - resize mode so that you can resize with hjkl and exit with esc
